  summary: Create environments where cycling is accessible to people of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds. Ensure that infrastructure supports diverse needs and does not exclude any group from participating in cycling.
- principle: User-Centricity
  summary: Focus on the user's journey, including their goals, needs, and experiences while cycling. Prioritize design decisions that enhance the user's overall experience and address specific challenges they may encounter.
- principle: Contextual Awareness
  summary: Consider the broader context of each cycling journey, including the surrounding environment, trip goals, and qualitative factors that influence user experience. Adapt infrastructure to fit the unique needs of each context.
- principle: Continuous Learning
  summary: Promote a culture of ongoing development and improvement. Regularly gather feedback, conduct research, and evaluate cycling infrastructure to ensure it remains effective and user-friendly.
- principle: Practical Application
  summary: Equip urban mobility professionals with actionable methods and tools to integrate user experience into their planning and design processes. Focus on practical, adaptable solutions that can be applied in various local contexts.
- principle: Collaborative Design
  summary: Encourage collaboration among a diverse range of stakeholders, including urban planners, engineers, and community members, to ensure that bicycle infrastructure reflects a wide range of needs and perspectives.
